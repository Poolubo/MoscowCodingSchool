                <h1>Logic–Young Jesus ft. Big Lenbo</h1>

                <p>The video for Logic's first single "Young Jesus" off his sophomore album is something I've been waiting for. The video (directed by Logic himself) of course features Big Lenbo and completely gave me something I wasn't expecting. And I still don't fully know what to make of it, if there's anything deeper to make of it at all.</p>
                <p>The visuals as a whole are rapid. The scenes happen so fast that they stay fully in sync with the rapid fire of Logic and Lenbo's rapping. The entire video feels like a movie, hence the entire scheme of Young Sinatra's forthcoming album. Logic and Lenbo play various characters in the video, from the robbers to the witness to the cook and the waiter, helping to create an entire story and world that plays up the movie feel that the album "The Incredible True Story" will present when it comes out. The hidden movie Easter eggs bring the film idea to a whole other level as well. The "Pup Fiction" movie poster with his dog, Fry, is a cute play on "Pulp Fiction" and a dope ode to Quentin Tarantino, big-upping the film director's influence on this video and the album.</p>
                <p>All those hidden images, 6ix, Logic's fiance and DJ Rhetorik's appearance puts so much personality in the video. It made all the visuals fun and a true experience to watch everything unfold. I really enjoyed it. The visuals showed me how far he's come conceptually. We're really getting something new with this album. It's more than music - this is an entire world and experience and this video encompasses all of that, just on a smaller scale. I can't wait to find out what else comes forth from the mind of Logic.</p>

                <h1>Devilman-Drum And Bass Father (Prod. DJ Looney) ft. Badness</h1>
                <p>On 1st October 2014 Devilman released ‘Drum And Bass Father’ on Sika Records, and while the track didn’t get much support in the club world it took on a life of it’s own via YouTube.</p>
                <p>Produced by DJ Looney from Birmingham, ‘Drum And Bass Father’ has to date racked up 38 million streams on Spotify, almost 24 million views on YouTube, and countless more across other streaming platforms!</p>
                <p>While the track may polarise fans of the genre, the stats speak for themselves making ‘Drum And Bass Father’ one of the most streamed D&B tracks of all time!</p>

                <h1>Giolì & Assia - BEBE</h1>

                <p>Your single " Bebe” came out on Ultra Music earlier this year, a sensational piece sung in Spanish. How would you describe the creative process of the project and why did you decide to sing in this language for the first time?</p>
                <p>As Italians, we receive a lot of influences from Latin Music, as it’s very popular in Italy. Our languages are also pretty similar, so we both understand Spanish. Assia speaks it fluently and this gave us the opportunity to have fun and write lyrics in a different language. We love Spanish so much, because it can be very romantic and sensual, the vibes that we wanted to create around our song “Bebe”. On the other hand our goal was also to connect more to our Latin American fans, giving them a song they could sing loud and relate to.</p>
